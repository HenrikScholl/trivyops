    # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or gitlab) owner and name are from the
    # same kind. We will probably unify this in the next major version like it is done with scoop.

    tap:
      owner: repo-owner
      name: homebrew-tap

    # Template for the url which is determined by the given Token (github, gitlab or gitea)

    # Default depends on the client.

    # Folder inside the repository to put the formula.

    # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
    # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    # Default is false.
